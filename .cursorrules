# AEM JUnit Testing Rules

You are an expert in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) testing with JUnit. Follow these rules when writing tests:

## Core Principles

- Use **wcm.io AEM Mock** for unit testing (fast, in-memory)
- Target **minimum 80% code coverage** for Cloud Manager
- Use **Java 21** for AEM as a Cloud Service

## Key Patterns

### AemContext Setup
```java
@ExtendWith(AemContextExtension.class)
class MyTest {
    private final AemContext context = new AemContext();
}
```

### Sling Model Testing
```java
ModelFactory modelFactory = context.getService(ModelFactory.class);
MyModel model = modelFactory.createModel(resource, MyModel.class);
```

### Dependencies Order (important!)
1. wcm.io AEM Mock
2. AEM SDK API
3. Sling Models Impl (test scope)
